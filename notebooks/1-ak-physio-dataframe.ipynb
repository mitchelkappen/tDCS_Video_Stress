    "# Physiological Dataframe creation\n",
    "This notebook creates the physiological signal dataframes for each participant. This is done for both the ACQ as well as the AMSDATA files. To both columns we add information about the start (moment) of the TSST speech component. Each created dataframe is stored in the `interim` folder as a `.feather` file, for use in the sampling and target computation steps later on.\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "To be able to run this notebook one needs to have collected the physiological data files for all the participants. These files need to be saved in `data\\raw\\Physiological`.\n",

    "This notebook handles both the ACQ and AMSDATA files. Since it is not possible to open the AMSDATA files from python, one needs to export the signals to `.txt` files using the AMSDATA software. This will result in two `.txt` files per participant, one for ECG and another one for SCL.\n",

    "Since the AMSDATA does not handle timing information, we also need to collect the timing information for each participant from the session information excel file. This timing information is stored in an `.csv` file in `data\\information`."

Since we now the exact length of each component we can then loop through the starting points corresponding to our desired components (in this case `[0,3,4,5,6]`) and extract the EDA and ECG signal aswell as the corresponding timestamps.

Instead, the experimenters in the study have indicated the starting points of each component in an excel file. The starting point of the TSST speech component is stored in the `started_TSST.csv` file. We open the file `start_TSST.csv` and store the information inside in a dict called `timings` where you can get the moment in the video of a certain participant (pp) where the TSST component starts in seconds (start) as follows: `start = timings['pp']`.\n",

Likewise to the `.acq` files, we take the subset of the data between 3 minutes prior to the start and 20 minutes after the start. This file is also stored in a `feather` file in the interim folder. "
