    "# Processing the windows\n",
    "This notebook focusses on the processing of the sampled windows, to prepare them to be used as training and test data in the modelling part. At this point it only involves checking how many participants are still included in the windows DataFrames and adding the age and gender information to all the windows. More processing steps, could be added to this notebook.\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "If one wants to run this notebook, make sure that you have run the `4-ak-window-sampling` notebook. This notebook is responsible for processing the windows DataFrames, stored in `data\\processed`, created by this previous notebook.\n",
    "You also need to have stored the demographics file `Demogr tDCS WM stress.csv` in the `data\\raw` directory."
